  <div class="mb-4">
    <p>A Driving License is a fundamental legal requirement for operating any motor vehicle on public roads in India. It serves as official permission granted by the government, certifying that the holder is competent and authorized to drive specific classes of vehicles. Issued by the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) or Regional Transport Office (RTO) of each state, it's a vital document for personal mobility and commercial operations alike.</p>

    <h2 class="text-info">Brief Description – What is it?</h2>
    <p>A Driving License is essentially a government authorization to drive. It specifies the class(es) of vehicles you are permitted to drive (e.g., motorcycles without gear, motorcycles with gear, light motor vehicles like cars, heavy motor vehicles like trucks or buses). It also contains your personal details, photograph, and signature, acting as a valid photo identification document. Beyond being a legal necessity for driving, it is often accepted as proof of identity and age for various other purposes.</p>
